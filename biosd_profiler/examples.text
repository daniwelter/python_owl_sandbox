SLAF-seq was employed in this study to obtain sufficient markers to construct a high-density genetic map for soybean. In total, 33.10 Gb of data containing 171,001,333 pair-end reads were obtained. The average sequencing depth was 42.29 in the male parent, 56.63 in the female parent, and 3.92 in each progeny. In total, 164,197 high-quality SLAFs were detected, of which 12,577 SLAFs were polymorphic, and 5,308 of the polymorphic markers met the requirements for use in constructing a genetic map. The final map included 5,308 markers on 20 linkage groups and was 2,655.68 cM in length, with an average distance of 0.5 cM between adjacent markers. To our knowledge, this map has the shortest average distance of adjacent markers for soybean. We report here the first high-density genetic map for soybean. The map was constructed using a recombinant inbred line population and the SLAF-seq approach, which allowed the efficient development of a large number of polymorphic markers in a short time., Genome of Mycobacterium chelonae, GTC_15348, Gifu284, P-179, NBRC_3rdRun_lane7_N708_S507, ChIP_seq library.

The saplings were maintained under ambient conditions and irrigated 2-3 times per week before use. Only healthy, mature leaves of F. septica were selected for analysis. Variability of isoprene emission and photosynthesis of F. septica in response to temperature was examined using a leaf chamber, a real time isoprene analyser, and a portable photosynthesis analyser in a phytotron, as described previously (Oku et al., Chemosphere 95, 268-273, 2014). Light (300 μmol•m-2•s-1 of PPFD) and dark cycle was maintained at 12-h:12-h (L:D). The temperature regime to which the saplings were exposed was 30-24-18-12-30-30 ?C for over six days (i.e. temperature was lowered from 30 ?C to 12 ?C in 6 ?C daily increments over the first four days and then elevated again to 30 ?C in the latter two days). Hereafter, the first four days and latter two days are referred to as Day -4 to -1 and Day 1 to 2, respectively. Temperatures were changed when switching from the dark to light phase.

Four micrograms of total RNA was used for library construction using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, poly-A containing mRNAs were purified using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. The purified mRNAs were fragmented using divalent cations under elevated temperatures, and then converted to dsDNA by two rounds of cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase I. After an end repair process, DNA fragments were ligated with adaptor oligos. The ligated products were amplified using 15 cycles of PCR to generate RNA-seq library. Library integrity was verified by Bioanalyzer DNA1000 assay (Agilent technologies).

This habitat is colonized by diverse microorganisms that affect plant health and growth. Not only their identity of these phyllosphere microorganisms, but in particular their responses to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration is poorly understood. Using a massive parallel pyrosequencing technique, we investigated the response of phyllosphere bacterial community in rice to elevated CO2 (eCO2) at tillering, filling, and maturation stages in a rice field under different level of nitrogen fertilization. Our analyses revealed 9 406 distinct OTUs (operational taxonomic units) that could be classified into 8 phyla, 13 classes, 26 orders, 59 families and 120 genera. The family Enterobacteriaceae of Gammaproteobacteria was the most dominant phylotype during rice growing seasons tested, accounting for 60.9-97.2% of the total microbial communities. eCO2 showed the trend of stimulating the relative abundance of dominant phylotype from 60.9-89.4% at aCO2 (ambient CO2) to 66.7-97.2% at eCO2 at all rice growing stages, but suppressing the overall rare phylotypes such as Moraxellaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Bacillaceae, Microbacteriaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Comamonadaceae from 6.56-33.6% at aCO2 to 1.31-25.0% at eCO2 in most cases. This contrasting response pattern was largely consistent at all growing stages tested and appeared to be insensitive to nitrogen fertilizations. Furthermore, eCO2 illustrated the trend of enhancing phyllosphere bacterial diversity at rice tillering and filling stages, while the opposite trend was observed at maturing stage. The results of this study provide a novel conceptual framework for moving toward a mechanistic understanding of phyllosphere bacterial responses to global climate changes., none provided, total RNA prepared from HeLa cells, total RNA prepared from THP-1 cells, replicate 2:Methane removal biofilter with pumice and GAC, replicate 3:Methane removal biofilter with pumice and GAC 3, replicate 1:Methane removal biofilter with pumice and GAC 1, replicate 4:Methane removal biofilter with pumice and GAC 4, ChIP_seq library.

In summary, we combined the dimer eliminators from (Kawano et al. 2010, BioTechniques, 49(4), pp.751???755), with template-switching (Ko &amp; Y. Lee 2006, Journal of Microbiological Methods, 64(3), pp.297???304) to enrich for capped RNAs (Plessy et al. 2010, Nature Methods, 7(7), pp.528???534 ). In brief, adenylated 3' adapters adenylated in 5' and blocked in 3' (5'-AppATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG-idT-3') were ligated to 3' ends of 3'-OH small RNAs using a truncated T4 RNA ligase 2 enzyme (NEB). cDNA was primed using a oligonucleotide complementary to the 3' adaptor in the presence of dimer eliminator and template-switching oligonucleotides ending with three random ribonucleotides 5'-TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAXXXrNrNrN-3 where is XXX is barcode'. The cDNAs were amplified using 12???15 PCR cycles using a forward primer targeting the 5' adaptor and extending it with additional sequence for bridge PCR, and a reverse primer targeting the 3' adaptor (which is ready for bridge PCR). The amplified cDNA library was run on a 6 % polyacrylamide gel and the 100 bp to 300 bp range containing cDNAs up to 200 nt-long inserts cut in three fractions according to the insert size: 1-50 nt, 50-150 nt and 1-200 nt.

G beads were washed 3 ?? 10 min at 4 ??C with 200 ??l IP buffer, resuspended in 200 ??l IP buffer and then supplemented with 50 ??g Protease K. RNA was separated from the beads by incubating at 40 ??C for 30 min, extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitated. The RNAs recovered for both IP and negative control were then dephosphorylated and decapped, and used to prepare libraries based on 5' adapter ligation (Kawano et al. 2010, BioTechniques, 49(4), pp.751???755). In addition, to capture sRNA that are not capped or sRNAs that have a 5' phosphate, control libraries were prepared from 1.6 ??g of THP-1 small RNA extracted by the mirVana (Ambion). All RNAs except for the control library were dephosphorylated by Shrimp Alkaline phosphatase (SAP, USB) according to manufacture recommendation, and then dephosphorylated with 1 unit of TAP (Epicentre) in the presence of 20 units of RNaseOUT.
